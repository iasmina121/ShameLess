It means that you talk about things that really matter. It means that you are not afraid to say what you really think and feel and that your partner trusts you the same way.\n\n" +

Your goal is to understand your partner's thoughts and feelings. When your partner talks about why he or she is upset, restate what you think you have heard to clarify what is really meant. Then express your own thoughts.\n\nLet your partner know that you care about what he or she is thinking and doing. Really try to understand what your partner feels. \n");

Your partner may not mean anything negative, yet you may feel insulted. \n\nFor example, your partner tells you about someone’s expensive condo and recent promotion. You might think your partner is criticizing you for not making enough money or not getting a better job.\n\nSometimes it seems you can’t talk about anything without offending each other. So you stop talking to each other to avoid arguing and fighting. Then each partner is upset by the silence of the other and sees it as punishment. Ask questions and clarify what your partner really means.\n\nPride and stubbornness get in the way of communication. We often expect our partners to understand without having to say anything. Tell your partner about your feelings, needs, and desires. If you find yourself saying “He should know what I want,” or “I shouldn’t have to tell her,” your communication skills need work.\n");

For example, say “I feel…I need…I want….”\n \nThis will help you to express yourself without being hostile. The goal is to make positive changes, not to make the other person feel guilty.\n");
