                "\n-going down, on the sides there are the 2 ovaries connected to the fallopian tube\n-the ovaries produce the egg cells, called the ova or oocytes; the oocytes are then transported to the fallopian tube where fertilization by a sperm may occur; the fertilized egg then moves to the uterus, where the uterine lining has thickened in response to the normal hormones of the reproductive cycle.\n" +
                "\n-between the uterus and the vagina there is the cervix-the cervix acts as the door to the uterus which sperm can travel through to fertilize eggs; when your body is not carrying a child, your cervix helps keep unhealthy things out of your body, like tampons and bath water\n" +
                "\n-and last but not least the vagina, and the hymen outside the vagina-the hymen is a stretchy collar of tissue at the entrance to your vagina; it can be compared to a scrunchie (hair tie) – with bunched-up tissue that expands when stretched (eg, during sex or using tampons) then returns to its bunched-up shape afterwards.\n");

        "-the testicles are responsible for making sperm and are also involved in producing a hormone called testosterone;\n\n-testosterone is an important hormone during male development and maturation for developing muscles, deepening the voice, and growing body hair.\n");
